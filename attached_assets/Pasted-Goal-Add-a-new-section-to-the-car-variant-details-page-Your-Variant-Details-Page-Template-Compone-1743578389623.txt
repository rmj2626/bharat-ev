Goal:
Add a new section to the car variant details page ([Your Variant Details Page Template/Component]) displaying the vehicle's suitability for long-distance travel. This involves calculating a "1-Stop Range" based on a standardized benchmark and assigning a corresponding star rating.

Data Requirements:
For the specific car variant being displayed, you need to fetch the following data points from the database:

Real Range (in km): Use the value representing realistic driving under average conditions.
10-80 time (in minutes): The time specified for DC fast charging from 10% to 80% State of Charge (SoC). Handle cases where this value is null, 0, or otherwise indicates the car cannot DC fast charge.
Useable Capacity (in kWh): Needed to calculate efficiency for duration estimates.
Backend Implementation (Calculation Logic):

Create a Calculation Function: Implement a function (e.g., calculate_long_distance_metrics) in your backend logic (likely in a service, helper, or within the controller/handler for the variant page). This function should accept real_range_km and time_10_80_min as primary inputs.
Calculate Leg 1 Distance:
Formula: leg1_distance_km = real_range_km * 0.9
Calculate Leg 2 Distance:
Check if the car can fast charge (i.e., time_10_80_min is valid and > 0).
If yes:
Formula: leg2_distance_km = (10.5 * real_range_km) / time_10_80_min
If no:
leg2_distance_km = 0.0
Calculate Total 1-Stop Range:
Formula: one_stop_range_km = leg1_distance_km + leg2_distance_km
Calculate Star Rating:
Use the one_stop_range_km value.
Implement the following logic based on the 2025 scale:
If one_stop_range_km < 200: rating = 0.0
If 200 <= one_stop_range_km < 325: rating = 1.0 + (one_stop_range_km - 200) / 125.0
If 325 <= one_stop_range_km < 450: rating = 2.0 + (one_stop_range_km - 325) / 125.0
If 450 <= one_stop_range_km < 575: rating = 3.0 + (one_stop_range_km - 450) / 125.0
If 575 <= one_stop_range_km < 700: rating = 4.0 + (one_stop_range_km - 575) / 125.0
If one_stop_range_km >= 700: rating = 5.0
Round the final rating to the nearest 0.5: star_rating = round(rating * 2) / 2.0
Calculate Durations (Requires Average Speed Assumption):
Assume an average driving speed for highway travel. Let's use avg_speed_kmh = 80 (
Calculate Efficiency (kWh/km) = Useable Capacity / Real Range (Handle potential division by zero if Real Range is 0).
leg1_duration_hours = leg1_distance_km / avg_speed_kmh
leg2_duration_hours = leg2_distance_km / avg_speed_kmh (if leg2_distance_km > 0, else 0)
charging_stop_duration_hours = 0.25 (15 minutes)
total_duration_hours = leg1_duration_hours + charging_stop_duration_hours + leg2_duration_hours (Only add charging stop if leg2_distance_km > 0)
Format Durations: Convert these hour values into strings like "Xh Ymin" (e.g., "4h 29min"). Create a helper function for this conversion. Store these formatted strings: leg1_duration_str, leg2_duration_str, total_duration_str.
Function Output: The calculation function should return an object/dictionary containing all the calculated values needed for the frontend:
leg1_distance_km (rounded to 1 decimal)
leg2_distance_km (rounded to 1 decimal)
one_stop_range_km (rounded to 1 decimal)
star_rating
leg1_duration_str
leg2_duration_str
total_duration_str
Optionally: a flag can_fast_charge (boolean)
Integration: In the backend controller/handler for the variant details page:
Fetch the required data (Real Range, 10-80 time, Useable Capacity).
Call the calculate_long_distance_metrics function with the fetched data.
Pass the resulting dictionary/object containing the metrics to the frontend template/view.
Handle cases where the calculation function might return null or indicate an error (e.g., essential data missing).
Frontend Implementation (Display Logic):

Locate Template: Open the template file responsible for rendering the car variant details page.
Add New Section: Create a new div or appropriate container for the "Long Distance Suitability" feature.
Add Explanatory Text: Include the introductory paragraphs explaining the concept of 1-Stop Range and the benchmark (use the text provided in the prompt).
Display Benchmark Results Table:
Use the provided HTML table structure as a guide.
Dynamically insert the calculated values passed from the backend into the <strong> tags:
[leg1_distance_km]
[leg1_duration_str]
[leg2_distance_km] (Show "0 km" or "N/A" if the car cannot fast charge)
[leg2_duration_str] (Show "0h 0min" or "N/A" if no leg 2)
[one_stop_range_km]
[total_duration_str]
The "Charging Stop" row values are static (0 km, 15 min). Adjust the Total Duration display if the car cannot fast charge (it would just be Leg 1 duration).
Display Star Rating:
Add the "5-Star Rating" heading and explanation.
Display the calculated [star_rating] value numerically (e.g., "Rating: 4.0 / 5.0 Stars").
Implement a visual representation of the stars (e.g., using ★ and ☆ characters, or dedicated star icons/CSS). Generate the correct number of full, half, and empty stars based on the [star_rating] value.
Include the list defining the star thresholds (0 stars < 200 km, 1 star 200-325 km, etc.).
Important Considerations:

Error Handling: Ensure the frontend gracefully handles situations where the long-distance suitability data might not be available (e.g., hide the section or display a "Data not available" message).
Consistency: Use the assumed avg_speed_kmh = 75 consistently for all duration calculations.
Clarity: Ensure the labels and explanations on the frontend are clear to the user.
